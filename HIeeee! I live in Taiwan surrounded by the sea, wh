HIeeee! I live in Taiwan surrounded by the sea, which locates at east Asia. I like surfing in the summer times, enjoy the feelings pushed by the waves. But in the most cases, I fall down into the sea and look like a living shit face haha. I am a talkative person, who love making new friends, hanging out with friends, and copying friends' codes. Just kidding, dont take it seriously! Speaking of code, I major in computer science and ready to enjoy my last period of college times in Masayrk. Hope somebody in Masayrk wanna be my buddy! I will definitely bring you a hometown gift to appretiate it!
